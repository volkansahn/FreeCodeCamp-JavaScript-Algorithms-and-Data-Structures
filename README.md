I have managed to finished FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course. 

This repo includes some of the algorithm solutions of mine. I tried to find the most efficient way to solve the problem. But I am sure there is more efficient way to solve for each problem.

1. Palindrome Checker
   Problem Link: [Palindrome Checker - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/palindrome-checker)
   Summary : Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
   Solution: [Palindrome Checker](https://github.com/volkansahn/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/blob/main/Palindrome%20Checker)
   Big-O-Notation : O(n)
   
2. Roman Numeral Converter
   Problem Link: [Roman Numeral Converter - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/roman-numeral-converter)
   Summary : Convert the given number into a roman numeral.
   Solution: [Roman Numeral Converter](https://github.com/volkansahn/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/blob/main/convertToRoman)
   Big-O-Notation : O(n)

4. Caesars Cipher
   Problem Link: [Caesars Cipher - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher)
   Summary: One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount. Write a function which takes a ROT13(13 letter shifted) encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
   Solution: [Caesars Cipher](https://github.com/volkansahn/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/blob/main/Caesars%20Cipher)
   Big-O-Notation : O(n)

6. Telephone Number Validator
   Problem Link: [Telephone Number Validator - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator)
   Summary: Return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.
   Solution: [Telephone Number Validator](https://github.com/volkansahn/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/blob/main/Telephone%20Check)
   Big-O-Notation : O(n)

8. Cash Register
   Problem Link: [Cash Register - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register)
   Summary : Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.
   Solution: [Cash Register](https://github.com/volkansahn/FreeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/blob/main/Check%20Cash%20Register)
   Big-O-Notation : O(n2)
